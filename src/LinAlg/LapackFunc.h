\brief Interface to some of the LAPACK functionality.

These are functions which more or less directly interface with the
Lapack provided algorithms.

For indepth reference to the LAPACK functions see:
  LAPACK Users' Guide - 3rd Edition,
  by E. Anderson et al.,
  ISBN 0-89871-447-8,
  Published by SIAM,

This book is also available at: \URL{http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/lapack_lug.html}

The official LAPACK sites where from the source can be downloaded are:
  \URL{http://www.netlib.org/clapack/} and
  \URL{http://www.netlib.org/lapack/}


NB: When running this in MS Visual C++ it is usually required to set the 
multithread "\MD" compiler option. This is to ensure correct linkage to the 
precompiled library "clapack.lib" and/or "clapackDB.lib".

\name Singular Value Decomposition SVD 

These functions perform the Singular Value Decomposition SVD of 
the MxN matrix A. The SVD is defined by:

  A=U*S*V^T

where:
- U is a M by M orthogonal matrix 
- V is a N by N orthogonal matrix 
- S is a M by N diaggonal matrix. The values in the diagonal are the singular values


\param  A the matrix to perform SVD on  
\return U will be resized if it is does not have the correct dimensions
\return V will be resized if it is does not have the correct dimensions
\return S will be resized if it is does not have the correct dimensions. 
\exception assert(info==0) for Lapack. Add a throw statement later.

\name Linear Least Squares
These functions solve the Linear Least Squares problem:

- A	is a M by N matrix. For a well formed M>=N and rank (A)=N. See below.
- b	is a M vector.
- x	is a N vector 

If the solution is not \em well \em formed the algorithm provided will find a
solution, x, which is not unique, but which sets the objective function
to 0. The reson being that the underlining algorithm works by SVD.

/**
\name Find eigensolutions of a symmetric real matrix.
This function accepts a real symmetric matrix Q and a vector b.
When the function returns, the eigenvalues of the matrix Q will be stored in b and
the eigenvectors form the columns of Q. This function is based on the
Lapack function dsyev, and returns its info code. A code of 0 indicates
success, and a code < 0 indicates an error. Probably Q is not a real symmetric matrix.
If the code is > 0 "the algorithm failed  to  converge;  code  off-diagonal  elements  
of an intermediate tridiagonal form did not converge to zero." Presumably this means that 
code contains the number of eigenvalues which are ok.
