    /** \brief Test for legal edge collapse.
    The argument h is the halfedge we want to collapse. 
    If this function does not return true, it is illegal to collapse h. 
    The reason is that the collapse would violate the manifold property of the mesh.
    The test is as follows:
    1.  For the two vertices adjacent to the edge, we generate a list of all their neighbouring vertices. 
    We then generate a  list of the vertices that occur in both these lists. 
    That is, we find all vertices connected by edges to both endpoints of the edge and store these in a list.
    2.  For both faces incident on the edge, chethis whether they are triangular. 
    If this is the case, the face will be removed, and it is ok that the the third vertex is connected to both endpoints. 
    Thus the third vertex in such a face is removed from the list generated in 1.
    3.  If the list is now empty, all is well. 
    Otherwise, there would be a vertex in the new mesh with two edges connecting it to the same vertex. Return false.
    4.  TETRAHEDRON TEST:
    If the valency of both vertices is three, and the incident faces are triangles, we also disallow the operation. 
    Reason: A vertex valency of two and two triangles incident on the adjacent vertices makes the construction collapse.
    5.  VALENCY 4 TEST:
    If a triangle is adjacent to the edge being collapsed, it disappears.
    This means the valency of the remaining edge vertex is decreased by one.
    A valency two vertex reduced to a valency one vertex is considered illegal.
    6.  PREVENT MERGING HOLES:
    Collapsing an edge with boundary endpoints and valid faces results in the creation where two holes meet.
    A non manifold situation. We could relax this...
	7. New test: if the same face is in the one-ring of both vertices but not adjacent to the common edge,
	then the result of a collapse would be a one ring where the same face occurs twice. This is disallowed as the resulting
	 face would be non-simple.	*/
